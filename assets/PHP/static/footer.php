    <p class="info">Most companies spend their money on ad agencies, TV commercials, radio spots, and billboards to tell you how good their products are. At Monster we choose none of the above. Instead, we support the scene, our bands, our athletes and our fans. We back athletes so they can make a career out of their passion. We promote concert tours, so our favorite bands can visit your home town. We celebrate with our fans and riders by throwing parties and making the coolest events we can think of a reality.

    At Monster we are all about the things you care about. What kid dreams about landing a 9 to 5 job? We all dreamed about being pro athletes, musicians and living the life. We know it takes encouragement and support to make that dream a reality, so we created the Monster Army to back the next generation pros, the future Ricky Carmichael, Jeremy McGrath, Dave Mirra, Danny Kass and Rob Dyrdek's.

    Some companies won't let you have any gear unless you're on the payroll. We're all about our fans rockin' the Monster logo the way they want - on hats, shirts, MX bikes, trucks, gear, or even on themselves. Our idea of a promotion isn't giving away a TV you already got. Our promos offer exclusive VIP access, insane trips hanging with top musicians, athletes, and real gear like dirt bikes, snowboards, BMX bikes, rims and helmets.
